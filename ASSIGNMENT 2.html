</head><h1>JELLOF RICE</h1><p>Jellof rice is a  western african delicacy of either Gambia or nigerian origin
  . it is one of the many ways rice can be prepared, if properly cooked it is tasty and delicious and can be eaten
  by any race or gender and age (exempting neonates). I like jellof rice because it is delicious and tasty to eat and because it is of african origin.
